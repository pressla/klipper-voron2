* ~~Resonance Compensation:~~ https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html
* ~~Add an intro line/purge line to start the print~~
* ~~Fame thermal compensation~~

### Software
* 1st layer tuning print macro
* Pressure advance tuning macro
* Part cooling fan override module, make part cooling fan run faster or slower during print time.
    * print is ruined because of not enough cooling.
    * print is ruined because of too much cooling.
    * print is ruined because of intermittent cooling (fan too low or off) that should be constant.
* ~~WAIT_THERMAL_EQUILIBRIUM~~
* ~~Build Sheet Manager~~
